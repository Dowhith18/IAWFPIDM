            <div class=" x-p-6-0" lang="en-US">Atmospheric air enters the intake system through the intake snorkel and goes into the air filter. After filtration process,
               the filtered air enters the eVGT. The filtered air now gets compressed in the turbocharger and the hot compressed air enters
               the intercooler.
            </div>
            <div class=" x-p-6-0" lang="en-US">The intercooler along with the fan cools the compressed hot air and sends it to the Electronic throttle control valve. The
               pressure and temperature of the air coming out of the intercooler is sensed by Boost pressure sensor and signals are sent
               to EMS ECU
            </div>
            <div class=" x-p-6-0" lang="en-US">Based on the input from Accelerator pedal sensor and other sensors, EMS ECU opens the Electronic throttle control valve and
               the position of Throttle control valve is sent as a feedback to EMS ECU. Air from the throttle control valve enters the intake
               manifold. The pressure and temperature of the air entering intake manifold is measured by T-MAP sensor and signals are sent
               to EMS ECU.

            <div class=" x-p-6-0" lang="en-US">Due to high pressure inside the combustion chamber, some of the unburnt fuel leak past the piston rings through piston ring
               gaps and goes down to the crankcase and mixes with the lubrication oil. Due to high temperature this unburnt fuel along with
               some amount of oil gets evaporated as blowby gases.
            </div>
            <div class=" x-p-6-0" lang="en-US">These blowby gases enters the oil separator , where the oil is separated from the blow by gas and the fuel vapours are sent
               into the intake side of the electric turbocharger.
